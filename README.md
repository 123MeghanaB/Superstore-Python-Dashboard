# Superstore-Python-Dashboard
This Python project focuses on analyzing sales data from a fictional Superstore to uncover key business insights and trends. Using powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project transforms raw transactional data into actionable intelligence.
# 🛍️ Superstore Sales Analysis – EDA & Visualization (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on the Sample Superstore dataset using Python. It is designed to uncover business insights related to sales, profit, customer segments, and regional performance. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
